I am an MSc student in Computer Science at the Sapienza University of Rome.

I am fascinated by `human cognition` and how neural networks try to emulate it. Currently, my research concerns `geometric deep learning` and how to employ `explainability` in this area. 
During my studies, I also did research in the `computer vision` field. In particular, I worked on `object detection` in a `few-shot scenario`.

I previously received a BSc in Computer Science still from Sapienza University, working on the analysis and development of a tool for translating biological models.
