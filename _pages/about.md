I am an MSc student in Computer Science at the Sapienza University of Rome.

My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning with an emphasis on adversarial robustness and explainability for graph neural networks and deep generative models.

Previously, I received a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Computer Science, both from the Sapienza University of Rome, working with the [GLADIA research group](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/members) led by [Emanuele Rodol√†](https://sites.google.com/site/erodola/), on the interpretability of deep models dealing with geometric data and graph representation learning in a few-shot scenario as well. Additionally, I have experience in the computer vision field.
